Overview
The full-color Boysâ€™ Love webtoon/manhwa (comic) that inspired the animation comes to English print for the first time! Donâ€™t miss this Mature-rated rom-com about a friendly office worker and his handsome (but tyrannical) boss!
 
 Itâ€™s been about a year since Lee Eunkyum started working at his office job. Heâ€™s outgoing and gets along well with his co-workers, but his success with romantic relationships is less than stellar, especially since he tends to fall hard and fast based on looks alone. History seems poised to repeat itself in the form of his new boss, Han Jihyuk.
 
 The handsome Han Jihyuk is exactly Lee Eunkyumâ€™s type, but his personality is a total turn-off as he proceeds to work Lee Eunkyum to the bone. The more aggravated Lee Eunkyum feels, the more he canâ€™t get Han Jihyuk off his mind. Could this heated attraction be mutual?
