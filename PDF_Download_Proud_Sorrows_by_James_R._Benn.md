Notes From Your Bookseller Perfect for fans of WWII fiction and historical mysteries, the Billy Boyle series is always a favorite. Not only is this a compelling mystery, but the level of historical research makes this a fascinating window into one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. In the eighteenth installment in this fan-favorite WWII mystery series, US Army Captain Billy Boyle investigates a murder in a charming English village, where personal vendettas tangle with wartime espionage.
 
 Norfolk, England, November 1944: After a series of dangerous missions in the South of France, US Army Captain Billy Boyle is finally on leave, and is settling into a peaceful rest at the country estate of Sir Richard Seaton, the father of Billyâ€™s British lover, Diana. Seaton Manor is a comfortable haven, and Billy is eager to spend a few precious days in Dianaâ€™s company pretending the war is far away.
 
 Unfortunately, Billyâ€™s leave is cut short when a crashed German bomber resurfaces off the coast with the corpse of a British officer in the pilot seat. The nearby village of Slewford hosts a top-secret military intelligence operation, home to high-ranking German POWs, and so the crash is a matter of national security. Billy is assigned by the commander of the POW facility to investigate. After the plane is discovered, a local villager is murderedâ€”and suddenly what had appeared to be a failed enemy military operation takes on an even more sinister aspect. All Billyâ€™s ex-Boston cop instincts are put to the test as he interviews the grieving, angry, and conniving citizens of this idyllic English country village in search of the truth.
