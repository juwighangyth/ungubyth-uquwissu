In this classic vampire thriller, a serious, staid grad student embraces her darker side to escape her abductors—and a deadly conspiracy.
 
 Toronto graduate student Ardeth Alexander lives by her schedule. There is no room for excitement in between classes, papers, and research jobs. She is known for being responsible, dependable—and perhaps a little boring. But all that changes during a routine morning walk when she is abducted by two thugs.
 
 Blindfolded and taken to an abandoned asylum, Ardeth is horrified to learn the reason behind her kidnapping: she is meant to provide sustenance for a centuries-old vampire. Dimitri Rozokov has been asleep for ninety years and now finds himself pushed to insanity from torture and his hunger for blood.
 
 Breaking past his madness, Ardeth discovers the man within, and the nightly feeding sessions become less frightening and more sensuous. But she knows there are only two ways this ordeal will end for her. Desperate to escape, eager for revenge, and tempted by immortality, she boldly descends into the darkness . . .

 “It’s almost impossible not to finish The Night Inside in one frenzied, chocolate donut munching sitting. It’s also impossible not to root for its feisty, feminist vampiress heroine.” —Charles Busch, author of Vampire Lesbians of Sodom
 
 “Terrific. . . . The unrelenting tension between the monstrous and the human propels this unique tale of gripping suspense.” —Katherine Ramsland, author of The Vampire Companion
 
 “In prose studded with passages of dark luster, Baker offers a truly original scenario.” —Publishers Weekly
 
 “Baker has obviously thought about what surrendering to the dark side means that lifts this book up above the vast . . . morass of romantic vampire fiction.” —Quill &amp;amp; Quire
