Overview
SHORTLISTED FOR THE WOMEN&#039;S PRIZE FOR FICTION 2024 The Women&#039;s Prize-winning and Booker-shortlisted international bestselling author returns with a fictionalised account of her grandmother&#039;s life Dolly Maunder is born at the end of the nineteenth century, when society&#039;s long-locked doors are just starting to creak ajar for determined women. Growing up in a poor farming family in rural New South Wales, Dolly spends her life doggedly pushing at those doors. A husband and two children do not deter her from searching for love and independence.
 
 Restless Dolly Maunder is a subversive, triumphant tale of a pioneering woman working her way through a world of limits and obstacles, who is able - despite the cost - to make a life she could call her own.
