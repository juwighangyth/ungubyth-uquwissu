Emily A. Jensen and Laura Wifler, bestselling authors of Risen Motherhood [over 150,000 copies sold], show moms how to navigate their everyday decisions and current circumstances through a biblical lens, and experience the freedom and confidence in who God made them to be.
 
 If there‚Äôs one thing moms love, it‚Äôs a formula. Give us the three-step process, the instruction manual, the straightforward solution for how to mother with excellence and we‚Äôll give it our best shot.
 
 But we all know motherhood isn‚Äôt that simple. Each decision seems to present a thousand overwhelming options, or our circumstances suddenly change and we can‚Äôt keep up with ‚Äúthe plan,‚Äù or we see another mom making different choices and begin to doubt our own.
 
 All of this leaves us questioning our decision-making in motherhood.
 
 So how can we find a secure identity in motherhood and know we‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù before the throne of God? By understanding the gospel story and how all of scripture applies to our lives. We need more than just to know what to do.
 We need to know who to be.
 
 Join Emily and Laura as together you explore what it truly means to be a gospel mom, a woman who is renewed by Christ‚Äôs righteousness, knows her mission and purpose, and lives free from guilt and unhealthy comparison.
 
 As friends, fellow moms, and expert guides, Emily and Laura walk you step-by-step through the practices and thinking of how to rest in the grace of Christ, gaining peace and assurance in your motherhood.
