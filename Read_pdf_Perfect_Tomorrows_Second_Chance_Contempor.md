Overview
Shay Morgan falls asleep every night and wakes every morning to the same thoughts. Adam died. He wasn&#039;t coming home. And she had no choice but to go through the rest of her life alone. For Shay, the last two years has been exhausting. Life has been a game of hiding the heartache endured by losing the only man she&#039;d ever loved. And she&#039;s been successful. To the folks of Black Moose, Vermont, she appears a strong woman who continues to enjoy life through her work as a construction company owner and her many community activities. In reality, she simply has been keeping her pain at bay. However, with the death of a beloved friend and the return of a spiteful businessman, her good-natured veneer cracks and once again she finds herself drowning in grief. A chance encounter with a handsome stranger- who sneaks past her defenses and infuses joy back into her life- teaches Shay that love is never replaced by another, and in order to truly live a full, rich life, she needs to let go of her past. But can she trust him? With a little meddling from the good folks of Black Moose, Shay and Ethan both might just get a lifetime of Perfect Tomorrows. Perfect Tomorrows is a heartwarming journey about loss, friendship, and a second chance at love. Shay and Ethan&#039;s story highlights that grief is universal, the healing process is unique for everyone, and peace and joy are always within reach.
